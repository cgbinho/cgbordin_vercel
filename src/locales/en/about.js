    title: 'Experience',
    paragraph01: `<p>I was fascinated with cartoons and Star Wars as a kid.<p>
    <p>Later in my life (1994), watching Toy Story for the first time, I understood what was the reason for my interest in all these fictional universes... <span>computer graphics fascinated me</span>.</p>
    `,
    paragraph02: `<p>Fast forward (2003), I <span>graduated in Industrial Design </span> with a specialization in Visual Programming (2003), where I learned about <span>Design, Motion Graphics and 3D Animation</span>, which led me to work with several advertising agencies, creating advertising pieces for big brands from Brazil and some world wide.</p>`,
    paragraph03: `<p>I studied the basics of entrepreneurship and <span>created Pictovalley Studio</span> (2011), a Motion Graphics Studio focused on Explainer and Institutional Videos, where I experiment with new techniques and concepts within After Effects.</p>`,
    paragraph04: `<p>That's where I had my first contact with expressions in <span>Javascript & Extendscript</span> (2013) - when I automated a layer's opacity state.</p>
    <p><span>I was instantly hooked</span>.</p>
    <p>From there, my interest in Programming reached new levels - creating scripts and expressions to organize scenes, build characters, control lights, save video files, and also improve workflow in general.<p>`,
    paragraph05: `<p>In 2019 was motivated to pursue more knowledge and create applications outside the Motion Design realm, so started learning more about <span>Node.js, React.js, Nextjs and other thechnologies</span>.</p>
    <p>This is my continuous, moldable state where I keep learning more to complement my skills, <span>seeking for ways to incorporate creativity and problem solving</span> along the way in my day to day work.</p>`,
