    paragraph01: `<p>My full name is Cleber Galves Bordin, I'm from São Paulo, Capital – Brazil.</p>
    <p>I was fascinated with cartoons, Star Wars as a kid.</p>
    <p>Later on, I understood what was the reason for my interest in all these fictional universes... <span>computer graphics fascinated me</span>.</p>
    `,
    paragraph02: `<p>Fast forward (2003), I <span>graduated in Industrial Design </span> with a specialization in Visual Programming (2003), where I learned about <span>Design, Motion Graphics and 3D Animation</span>, which led me to work with several advertising agencies, creating advertising pieces for big brands from Brazil and some world wide.</p>`,
    paragraph03: `<p>I studied the basics of entrepreneurship and <span>created Pictovalley Studio</span> (2011), a Motion Graphics Studio focused on Explainer and Institutional Videos.</p>
    <p>That's where I had my first contact with expressions in <span>Javascript & Extendscript</span> (2013) - when I automated a layer's opacity state.</p>
    <p><span>I was instantly hooked</span>.</p>`,
    paragraph04: `<p>From there, my interest in Programming reached new levels - creating scripts and expressions to organize scenes, build characters, save video files, and also improve workflow in general.<p>
    <p>From 2019 and on, I was completely immersed in the Javascript Ecosystem, using <span>Node.js, React.js, Nextjs and other technologies</span>.</p>`,
    paragraph05: `<p>This is my continuous, moldable state where I keep learning more to complement my skills, <span>seeking for ways to incorporate creativity and problem solving</span> along the way in my day to day work.</p>`,
    paragraph06: `<p>I started working with <span>Motion Design</span> in 2003 for several advertising agencies from Brazil and from around the world. In 2013, I started developing for Adobe After Effects and really loved what could be done! <span>Html, CSS and Javascript</span> helped me to automate scenes, rigged characters, lights, and other magic stuff!</p>
    <p>I was really immersed in the Javascript ecosystem, so I took a deep dive in <span>Node.js, React and Next.js</span> in 2019, and today I work with all things related to Front-end and UX Motion Design.</p>`,
